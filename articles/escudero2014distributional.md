### Abstract
Evidence of distributional learning, a statistical learning mechanism centered on relative frequency of exposure to different tokens,
has mainly come from short-term learning and therefore does not ostensibly address the development of important learning processes. 
The present longitudinal study examines both short- and long-term effects of distributional learning of phonetic categories on non-native 
sound discrimination over a 12-month period. Two groups of listeners were exposed to a two-minute distribution of auditory stimuli in
which the most frequently presented tokens either approximated or exaggerated the natural production of the speech sounds, whereas a 
control group listened to a piece of classical music for the same length of time. Discrimination by listeners in the two distribution 
groups improved immediately after the short exposure, replicating previous results. Crucially, this improvement was maintained after 
six and 12 months, demonstrating that distributional learning has long-lasting effects.

### Summary
- Two-minute exposure to distributions yields immediate improvement in non-native sound discrimination.
- Improvement immediately after exposure is maintained after six and 12 months.
